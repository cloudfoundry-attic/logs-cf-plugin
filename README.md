# Logs-cf-plugin has moved

This repository held the legacy development plugin to access application logging in Cloud Foundry.

Please use [the beta CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) (which now includes this feature).

If you really need to, you can still [access this unmaintained plugin in the attic](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/logs-cf-plugin).
